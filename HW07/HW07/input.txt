Gandalf the Grey was originally Olorin, a Maia spirit of wisdom who lived in the Undying Lands before being sent to Middle earth as one of the five Istari to guide its people against Sauron. Disguised as an old wanderer, he became a key force in the fight against darkness, aiding the Free Peoples and leading the Fellowship of the Ring. After falling in battle against the Balrog in Moria, he was resurrected as Gandalf the White, more powerful and tasked with completing his mission. He played a crucial role in defeating Sauron, and after the war, he departed Middle earth aboard the White Ship, returning to the Undying Lands.
